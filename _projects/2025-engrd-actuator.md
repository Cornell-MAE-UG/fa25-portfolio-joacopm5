The mechanism consists of a bar of $L = 0.608\,\text{m}$ and is driven by the actuator at a radius of $r = 0.45\,\text{m}$. The base of the actuator is pinned to the ground at $x = 85\,\text{cm}$ while the bar is pinned to the ground at $x = 45\,\text{cm}$.

If we have the pivot at $A$, the bar makes an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal, and tip load $W$ acts downward a distance $L$ from $A$. $F_{\text{act}}$ acts along its own line at point $J$ a distance $r$ from $A$ along the bar. Then, we can let $\alpha$ be the angle between the bar and the actuator force, or between $\vec{\mathbf{r}}_j$ and $\vec{\mathbf{F}}_{\text{act}}$.

**Moment about $A$:**
$$
W\,L\cos\theta \;=\; F_{\text{act}}\,r\sin\alpha
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
W \;=\; F_{\text{act}}\left(\frac{r}{L}\right)\left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\theta}\right).
$$

**Height change:**
$$
\Delta h \approx L\big(\sin\theta_2 - \sin\theta_1\big).
$$

With $F_{\text{act}} = 4.45\,\text{kN}$, $\alpha = 62^\circ$ (Law of Sines), $\theta = 57^\circ$, $r = 0.45\,\text{m}$, $L = 0.61\,\text{m}$:
$$
W \approx 5.3\,\text{kN}, \qquad \frac{W}{F_{\text{act}}} \approx 1.2.
$$

To maximize mechanical advantage, we trade lift. In order to maximize MA and lift for bar length $L$ within the workspace, we set $\alpha = 90^\circ$, allow more stroke, increase $L$ or use a beefier actuator.
