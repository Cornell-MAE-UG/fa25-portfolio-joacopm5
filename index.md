## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Joaquin Perez, and I am passionate about blending engineering, creativity, and community impact. As a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, I enjoy tackling complex challenges in design and problem-solving while also pursuing broader interests in biochemistry research, public health education, and sustainability. My involvement with ALPFA and Cornell Hyperloop has strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and project management skills, while my curiosity drives me to constantly expand my knowledge in areas like robotics, statics, and thermodynamics. I take pride in finding ways to merge technical knowledge with meaningful real-world outcomes.

Outside of academics, I am deeply engaged in community initiatives and creative pursuits. I value opportunities to contribute through volunteering and health-related outreach, while also exploring my artistic side as a way to balance the technical with the expressive. I enjoy ballroom dancing, art, and building personal projects that connect mechanical engineering principles with hands-on creativity. Whether itâ€™s working on innovative designs, educating others about health, or bringing people together through leadership, I aim to create an impact that is both technically sound and socially meaningful.
